<div class="bio-text">
  <p class="bio">Skye McLean was born January 31st, 1987 in Canada in the city of Trail, British Columbia. Skye began learning drums and percussion through a local Sea Cadets outfit. After demonstrating his interest at the age of 12 Skye was gifted his very first drum set for his birthday and began practicing daily. He enrolled in school band class from grade 8-12 and performed in stage,
     concert and jazz band growing up. He performed & played in a few cover/original songs bands during his formulative adolescence.<br>
  <br>
    After high school Skye went on to attend Lethbridge Community College in Alberta where he studied Print Journalism and continued his music career drumming for local band <strong>Olympia in Ruin</strong> which was a Christian-Rock/Hardcore band. Though Skye did not practice religion he put his heart in to the band and helped write and release two EPs and performed a number 
    of shows including two BC/Alberta tours.
<br><br>
    Skye later dropped out of college in his final semester due to disinterest in journalistic writing and a desire to focus on musical endeavours. His next project was a power-metal band called <strong>Archon Legion</strong> that he joined who were already established and in need of a drummer. This
    brought him to Victoria, BC where he currently resides. After multiple tours including 2 cross-Canada tours, releasing several studio songs and performing with the band for 3 years Skye left the project to focus on self-development.
<br><br>
    Skye rejoined a few members of Archon Legion a year later to play in a technical-progressive metal band called <strong>Robot Metropolis</strong>. After less than a year the group disbanded despite having garnered a local fan base. Skye then joined a female-fronted 
    rock/metal alt group called <strong>This Day Burns</strong> to help fill the role of a guitarist/drummer/bassist. The members of TDB rotated instruments during their performances and Skye learned how to write and play guitar/bass during this time much more proficiently
    as a result. After two years the band broke up due to creative differences. This Day Burns released a 6 song EP featuring Skye on drums and guitar shortly after their split.
    <br><br>
    Skye had joined the band <strong>Vaultry</strong> during his time in This Day Burns and was putting in a lot of time with music. Vaultry was already established as a local metal/alternative act and was gaining local popularity. Skye played with Vaultry for 3 years releasing his first full studio album called <em>Eulogy</em> which was a tribute to their late guitarist 'Chasen Fraser'
    who passed away from lymphoma. The band toured cross-Canada in support of their full length album and played a number of sold out local shows in Victoria, BC. After 3 years with the project Skye left the band to pursue other interests.
    <br><br>
    Currently Skye is playing drums in an electro-pop alt rock band called <strong>Cold Fame</strong> based out of Victoria, BC. They have a BC tour under their belt and a planned full album release coming in 2024 currently untitled.
    <br><br>
    Skye also spends his time exercising, learning and practicing web development, streaming games on Twitch.tv 3-4 nights weekly and maintaining a healthy community on Discord. Skye has uploaded several drum covers to YouTube over the years and often can be found working on content or editing video. He also spends time with his girlfriend and works for Save-On Foods as a deli cook.
